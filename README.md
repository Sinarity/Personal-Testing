# Testing

## This Repository simply has experiments and random code that I wanted to test out

## Imaging

This is an the imaging folder that converts images into ASCII images.

To use: python img.py {image file}. Changes image file into img.txt. Best viewed with Notepad or any text editor that doesn't use line wrap. Please note the image needs to be monochome/greyscale. Also note that you might need to invert the image colors if you want to display on a white background. I have no idea why, but sometimes, the ASCII image doesn't show the original colors that easily, and prefers the inverted version.

## Names

This is a random name generator. Any number random names of your choice, will be generated. The code will also rule out any duplicate names.
