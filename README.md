# Testing

## This Repository simply has experiments and random code that I wanted to test out

## Imaging

This is an the imaging folder that converts images into ASCII images.

To use: python img.py {image file}. Changes image file into img.txt. Best viewed with any text editor that doesn't use line wrap (For me, I used Notepad at 10% zoom with Lucida Console Regular text at size 7). Please note the image needs to be monochome/greyscale. Also note that you might need to invert the image colors if you want to display on a white background. I have no idea why, but sometimes, the ASCII image doesn't show the original colors that easily, and prefers the inverted version.

## Names

This is a random name generator. Any number random names of your choice, will be generated. The code will also rule out any duplicate names. Sorting the names still needs to be coded sometime.

## Number

This is a random number generator, however, it generates for two variables and attempts to match then together. The code itself was constructed to ensure it is compatible with less than average PCs and laptops as the entire console print was done on a single line. This effectivly allows the program to try and match random numbers between very large digits.

To use, simply change the values of variables 'i' and 'j' and run the program. I have yet to add a more interactive version, such as letting the user choose the numbers rather than hardcoding them.
